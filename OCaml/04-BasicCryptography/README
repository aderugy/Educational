School project where we had to reproduce some basic ciphers in OCaml.

There are two parts to this project.
1/ Builtin -> basics ciphers using builtin int implementation (small numbers)
2/ Scalable -> same as builtin, but with infinite numbers stored as bitarrays

Time spent: around 3 full days of work.
